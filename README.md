## A dash Application
### Description
This was my first real attempt at creating a Dash application using Dash and Python. 

I was really interested in creating a layout of multiple rows and columns and then applying Styling to this.
It is a training app for me so I can work through issues and resolve them as I go.

There are 3 main files in this app

*app.py* - The main Dash application
*data_import.py* - An app that handles reading in the data for the main app and returns it in a format ready to be coonsumed.
*fake_data.py* - This file can be used to generate fake data to fill the dashboard. It is rudimentary, but demonstrated the creation and use of a Faker provider class.
